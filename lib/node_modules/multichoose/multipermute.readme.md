"Loopless Generation of Multiset Permutations using a Constant Number of Variables by Prefix Shifts." Aaron Williams, 2009

This algorithm is so awesome that it hurts. It 
uses constant memory and linear time to generate all multiset combinations of size ``k`` from a set of size ``n``.
Permuting each of the results would generate all possible ordered multisets of size ``k`` from your ``n`` objects.
